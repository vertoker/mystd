## mystd

Study realization of all popular types from STL
- All types uses `mystd::` extension
- For everything with compilation/execution/testing, I use `cmake`
- At current moment, this code can't be used as library (skill issue)
- For testing all types, I use `ctest`
- Everything written in VS Code (some additional info)
